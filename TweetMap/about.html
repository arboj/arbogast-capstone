<h1>Explore Locations Mentioned in Natural Disaster Tweets</h1>

<b>Introduction:</b>
<div class="a">
Welcome to The Natural Disaster Tweet Mapper: This project explored a workflow and method to condition, classify, geolocate and map unstructured data from social media in order to discover clusters of locations mentioned in natural disaster social media posts. This method collected posts from Twitter leveraging the scscrape python library, and processed and conditioned the text of the posts. </div>
<div class="a">A binary classification recurrent neural network was trained in TensorFlow with Keras using human labeled tweets aggregated by the CrisisBenchmark dataset created by the Crisis NLP project at the Qatar Computing Research Institute. The text of the training data was vectorized using a pre-trained text embedding built from tweets using the Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVE)  methodology and available from the GloVe Project at Stanford University (Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014). Hyperparameters for the model were tuned with the Hyperband algorithm, and the final model was evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation. The model and text embedding built from the training data were used to classify tweets pulled from June and July 2021 for natural disaster informativeness. </div>
<div class="a">The resulting informative tweets were then parsed for location and georeferenced using the Mordecai python library. Finally, the informative posts with locations mentioned in the text were displayed in an interactive R shiny web application for end users to map location explore by  filtering data by geography, date and time, and research interest; discover trending topics on their selected data in a word cloud and export data for use by analysts in further research and visualization.

<div class="a">
<b>Group Filters:</b>
</div>
<div class="b"><b>
Fire and Heat Related</b> - Filters tweets related to wildfire, extreme heat and heat waves
</div>
<div class="b"><b>Geological/Movement</b> - Filters for tweets related to Geological events and mass movements such as landslides , tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic activity, avalanches , and sinkholes</div>
<div class="b"><b>Severe Weather</b> - Filters for tweets related to Severe weather such as thunderstorms, blizzards, tornados, and hail</div>
<div class="b"><b>Tropical Weather</b> -  Filters for tweets related to tropical weather such as Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, and Tropical Storms</div>
<div class="b"><b>Floods</b>  -  Filters for  tweets relating to flood activity

<p>The crisis benchmark dataset consists data from several different data sources such as CrisisLex (<a href="http://crisislex.org/data-collections.html#CrisisLexT26" target="_blank">CrisisLex26</a>, <a href="http://crisislex.org/data-collections.html#CrisisLexT6" target="_blank">CrisisLex6</a>), <a href="https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/lrec2016/lrec2016.html" target="_blank">CrisisNLP</a>, <a href="http://mimran.me/papers/imran_shady_carlos_fernando_patrick_practical_2013.pdf" target="_blank">SWDM2013</a>, <a href="http://mimran.me/papers/imran_shady_carlos_fernando_patrick_iscram2013.pdf" target="_blank">ISCRAM13</a>, Disaster Response Data (DRD), <a href="https://data.world/crowdflower/disasters-on-social-media" target="_blank">Disasters on Social Media (DSM)</a>, <a href="https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/crisismmd" target="_blank">CrisisMMD</a> and data from <a href="http://aidr.qcri.org/" target="_blank">AIDR</a>. 
	  The class label was mapped, remove duplicates removed and this was provided as a benchmark results for the community. </p>

<li>
<p>It uses <a href="https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/">spaCy</a>'s named entity recognition to
extract placenames from the text.</p>

gazetteer in an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch" rel="nofollow">Elasticsearch</a> index
(with some custom logic) to find the potential coordinates of
extracted place names.</p>

<p>It uses neural networks implemented in <a href="https://keras.io/" rel="nofollow">Keras</a> and trained on new annotated
English-language data labeled with <a href="https://prodi.gy/" rel="nofollow">Prodigy</a> to infer the correct country and correct gazetteer entries for each
